# projects
This is a test repository that contains my projects, many of which were created using SFML 2.5.1
Details of each project are included in an "ABOUT" file in the respective folders
It is important to note that some project might be depended upon others so moving the files is not advised (many things rely on Spritesheet_Lib)

# TODO
- [ ] Rewrite SpriteModule to use updated variable naming conventions
- [ ] Create a sample for Petri_Dish (Conway's game of life)
- [ ] Add ABOUT file to Petri_Dish
- [ ] Isometric Renderer
- [ ] Change between function to a template so that it's useful later
